## Secondary

- [ ] Have user be able to create and select users (different scores)
- [ ] What other infos could be added 
  - [ ] Population
  - [ ] Position on a map (show continent, highlight & circle if small)
- [ ] Data agnostic -> so that we can create different quizzes
  - [ ] Add support for png/jpeg (/!\ requires a way to load images to phone)
  - [ ] Remove cca, and move independent to "harder difficulty"
  - [ ] Add categories names to json
